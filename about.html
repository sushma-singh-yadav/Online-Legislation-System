   <h1> Who are we? </h1>
   <p id="p6">
      We focuses on facilitating the cumbersome litigation system online for citizens and lawyers to access with ease. We would include maintaining database for the lawyers and the cases put up by the citizens. 
      <br><br>
      We will allow the lawyers to take up the cases of their interest and can contact the citizens of that particular case. Also, citizens can put up their cases and can search the particular lawyers for their cases. We will allow the user to find out the sections for a particular crime.
   </p>
   <h1> Motivation </h1>
     <p id="p6"> Our honorable constitution of India has numerous provision to safeguard the rights and security of its citizens. But, not many people are aware about the litigation procedures that they can use to channelize the solution to their problems and seek justice. 
     <br><br>
     Since, the number of laws and citizens that this website will be connecting is large, we start off with taking women-related laws into focus. We do this in favor of getting women aware of their rights and equipping them with the litigation help involved to seek justice.
